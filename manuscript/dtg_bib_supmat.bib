abstract = {BACKGROUND There is concern over increasing prevalence of non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance in people initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in low-income and middle-income countries. We assessed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alternative public health responses in countries in sub-Saharan Africa where the prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance to NNRTIs is high. METHODS The HIV Synthesis Model is an individual-based simulation model of sexual HIV transmission, progression, and the effect of ART in adults, which is based on extensive published data sources and considers specific drugs and resistance mutations. We used this model to generate multiple setting scenarios mimicking those in sub-Saharan Africa and considered the prevalence of pretreatment NNRTI drug resistance in 2017. We then compared effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alternative policy options. We took a 20 year time horizon, used a cost effectiveness threshold of US{\$}500 per DALY averted, and discounted DALYs and costs at 3{\%} per year. FINDINGS A transition to use of a dolutegravir as a first-line regimen in all new ART initiators is the option predicted to produce the most health benefits, resulting in a reduction of about 1 death per year per 100 people on ART over the next 20 years in a situation in which more than 10{\%} of ART initiators have NNRTI resistance. The negative effect on population health of postponing the transition to dolutegravir increases substantially with higher prevalence of HIV drug resistance to NNRTI in ART initiators. Because of the reduced risk of resistance acquisition with dolutegravir-based regimens and reduced use of expensive second-line boosted protease inhibitor regimens, this policy option is also predicted to lead to a reduction of overall programme cost. INTERPRETATION A future transition from first-line regimens containing efavirenz to regimens containing dolutegravir formulations in adult ART initiators is predicted to be effective and cost-effective in low-income settings in sub-Saharan Africa at any prevalence of pre-ART NNRTI resistance. The urgency of the transition will depend largely on the country-specific prevalence of NNRTI resistance. FUNDING Bill {\&} Melinda Gates Foundation, World Health Organization.},

Age bias in survey sampling and implications for estimating HIV prevalence in men who have sex with men: insights from mathematical modelling. Epidemiology and Infection 146, 1036-1042. https://doi. Abstract Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is widely used to estimate HIV prevalence in men who have sex with men (MSM). Mathematical models that are calibrated to these data may be compromised if they fail to account for selection biases in RDS surveys. To quantify the potential extent of this bias, an agent-based model of HIV in South Africa was calibrated to HIV prevalence and sexual behaviour data from South African studies of MSM, first reweighting the modelled MSM population to match the younger age profile of the RDS surveys (age-adjusted analysis) and then without reweighting (unadjusted analysis). The model estimated a median HIV prevalence in South African MSM in 2015 of 34.6{\%} (inter-quartile range (IQR): 31.4-37.2{\%}) in the age-adjusted analysis, compared with 26.1{\%} (IQR: 24.1-28.4{\%}) in the unadjusted analysis. The median lifetime risk of acquiring HIV in exclusively homosexual men was 88{\%} (IQR: 82-92{\%}) in the age-adjusted analysis, compared with 76{\%} (IQR: 64-85{\%}) in the unadjusted analysis. These results suggest that RDS studies may underestimate the exceptionally high HIV prevalence rates in South African MSM because of over-sampling of younger MSM. Mathematical models that are calibrated to these data need to control for likely over-sampling of younger MSM.},

abstract = {In 2004, KwaZulu-Natal initiated one of the world's largest HIV/AIDS treatment programs. Studies in South Africa have shown that patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) develop rapidly and transmit drug resistant mutations. Since resistance testing is not widely available in Kwazulu-Natal, the Department of Health conducted the first HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) threshold survey in 2005, which did not identify any mutations associated with HIVDR. The objective of this study was to conduct a follow-up threshold survey to update the information on HIVDR. This study was conducted in 2009 in five antenatal care sites in Kwazulu-Natal using the HIVDR threshold survey method developed by WHO. Two hundred and thirteen newly-diagnosed HIV positive, drug-na{\"{i}}ve primigravidae, less than 22 years of age were included in the survey. Of the 82 HIV positive specimens, 17 had insufficient volume for genotyping and, of the remaining 65, 47 were genotyped sequentially. Drug resistance was identified by sequencing the HIV-1 pol gene, using the ViroSeq{\textregistered} HIV-1 genotyping system v2.0. Of the 47 samples that were genotyped, only one presented with a K103N mutation, which equates to a prevalence of transmitted HIVDR of {\textless}5{\%}. The low prevalence of transmitted HIVDR is in keeping with statistical models of the early stages of ART rollout. As ART coverage is increasing continuously, there is a need to ensure that vigilance of HIVDR continues so that the emergence and spread of HIVDR is minimized.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Effective HIV prevention programs rely on accurate estimates of the per-act risk of HIV acquisition from sexual and parenteral exposures. We updated the previous risk estimates of HIV acquisition from parenteral, vertical, and sexual exposures, and assessed the modifying effects of factors including condom use, male circumcision, and antiretroviral therapy. METHODS We conducted literature searches to identify new studies reporting data regarding per-act HIV transmission risk and modifying factors. Of the 7339 abstracts potentially related to per-act HIV transmission risk, three meta-analyses provided pooled per-act transmission risk probabilities and two studies provided data on modifying factors. Of the 8119 abstracts related to modifying factors, 15 relevant articles, including three meta-analyses, were included. We used fixed-effects inverse-variance models on the logarithmic scale to obtain updated estimates of certain transmission risks using data from primary studies, and employed Poisson regression to calculate relative risks with exact 95{\%} confidence intervals for certain modifying factors. RESULTS Risk of HIV transmission was greatest for blood transfusion, followed by vertical exposure, sexual exposures, and other parenteral exposures. Sexual exposure risks ranged from low for oral sex to 138 infections per 10,000 exposures for receptive anal intercourse. Estimated risks of HIV acquisition from sexual exposure were attenuated by 99.2{\%} with the dual use of condoms and antiretroviral treatment of the HIV-infected partner. CONCLUSION The risk of HIV acquisition varied widely, and the estimates for receptive anal intercourse increased compared with previous estimates. The risk associated with sexual intercourse was reduced most substantially by the combined use of condoms and antiretroviral treatment of HIV-infected partners.},

abstract = {As more human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients access combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), higher proportions of newly infected patients may be infected with drug-resistant viruses. Regular surveillance of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is required in southern Africa where high rates of transmission persist despite rapid expansion of ART. Dried blood spot samples from cART-naive participants from two rounds of an annual population-based HIV surveillance program in rural KwaZulu-Natal were tested for HIV RNA, and samples with HIV RNA {\textgreater}10,000 copies/ml were genotyped for drug resistance. The 2009 surveillance of drug resistance mutation (SDRM) list was used for drug resistance interpretation. The data were added to previously published data from the same program, and the $\chi$(2) test for trend was used to test for trend in estimated prevalence of any TDR. Seven hundred and one participants' data were analyzed: 67 (2010), 381 (2011), and 253 (2012). No TDR was detected in 2010. Years 2011 and 2012 had 18 participants with SDRMs 4.7{\%} and 7.1{\%}, respectively (p = .02, $\chi$(2) test for trend). The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutation, K103N, was the most common mutation, occurring in 27 (3.8{\%}) of the participants, while nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) SDRMs were detected in 10 (1.4{\%}) of the participants, of whom eight had only a single NRTI SDRM. The increase in levels of drug resistance observed in this population could be a signal of increasing transmission of drug-resistant HIV. Thus, continued surveillance is critical to inform public health policies around HIV treatment and prevention.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Routine HIV-1 antiretroviral drug resistance testing for patients failing NNRTI-based regimens is not recommended in resource-limited settings. Therefore, surveys are required to monitor resistance profiles in patients failing ART. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst patients failing NNRTI-based regimens in the public sector throughout South Africa. Virological failure was defined as two consecutive HIV-1 viral load results {\textgreater}1000 RNA copies/mL. Pol sequences were obtained using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing and submitted to Stanford HIVdb v7.0.1. RESULTS A total of 788 sequences were available for analysis. Most patients failed a tenofovir-based NRTI backbone (74.4{\%}) in combination with efavirenz (82.1{\%}) after median treatment duration of 36 months. K103N (48.9{\%}) and V106M (34.9{\%}) were the most common NNRTI mutations. Only one-third of patients retained full susceptibility to second-generation NNRTIs such as etravirine (36.5{\%}) and rilpivirine (27.3{\%}). After M184V/I (82.7{\%}), K65R was the most common NRTI mutation (45.8{\%}). The prevalence of K65R increased to 57.5{\%} in patients failing a tenofovir regimen without prior stavudine exposure. Cross-resistance to NRTIs was often observed, but did not seem to affect the predicted activity of zidovudine as 82.9{\%} of patients remained fully susceptible to this drug. CONCLUSIONS The introduction of tenofovir-based first-line regimens has dramatically increased the prevalence of K65R mutations in the HIV-1-infected South African population. However, most patients failing tenofovir-based regimens remained fully susceptible to zidovudine. Based on these data, there is currently no need to change either the recommended first- or second-line ART regimens in South Africa.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE We compiled the largest dataset of seroconverter cohorts to date from 25 countries across Africa, North America, Europe, and Southeast/East (SE/E) Asia to simultaneously estimate transition rates between CD4 cell stages and death, in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive HIV-1-infected individuals. DESIGN A hidden Markov model incorporating a misclassification matrix was used to represent natural short-term fluctuations and measurement errors in CD4 cell counts. Covariates were included to estimate the transition rates and survival probabilities for each subgroup. RESULTS The median follow-up time for 16 373 eligible individuals was 4.1 years (interquartile range 1.7-7.1), and the mean age at seroconversion was 31.1 years (SD 8.8). A total of 14 525 individuals had recorded CD4 cell counts pre-ART, 1885 died, and 6947 initiated ART. Median (interquartile range) survival for men aged 20 years at seroconversion was 13.0 (12.4-13.4), 11.6 (10.9-12.3), and 8.3 years (7.9-8.9) in Europe/North America, Africa, and SE/E Asia, respectively. Mortality rates increase with age (hazard ratio 2.22, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.84-2.67 for {\textgreater}45 years compared with {\textless}25 years) and vary by region (hazard ratio 2.68, 1.75-4.12 for Africa and 1.88, 1.50-2.35 for Asia compared with Europe/North America). CD4 cell decline was significantly faster in Asian cohorts compared with Europe/North America (hazard ratio 1.45, 1.36-1.54). CONCLUSION Mortality and CD4 cell progression rates exhibited regional and age-specific differences, with decreased survival in African and SE/E Asian cohorts compared with Europe/North America and in older age groups. This extensive dataset reveals heterogeneities between regions and ages, which should be incorporated into future HIV models.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In order to assess the level of transmitted and/or pre-treatment antiretroviral drug resistance to HIV-1, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that regular surveys are conducted. This study's objective was to assess the frequency of HIV-1 antiretroviral drug resistance in patients initiating antiretroviral treatment (ART) in the public sector throughout South Africa. METHODS A prospective cross-sectional survey was conducted using probability proportional to size sampling. This method ensured that samples from each province were proportionally collected, based on the number of patients receiving ART in each region. Samples were collected between March 2013 and October 2014. Pol sequences were obtained using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing and submitted to the Stanford Calibrated Population Resistance tool v6.0. RESULTS A total of 277 sequences were available for analysis. Most participants were female (58.8{\%}) and the median age was 34 years (IQR: 29-42). The median baseline CD4-count was 149 cells/mm3 (IQR: 62-249) and, based on self-reporting, participants had been diagnosed as HIV-positive approximately 44 days prior to sample collection (IQR: 23-179). Subtyping revealed that 98.2{\%} were infected with HIV-1 subtype C. Overall, 25 out of 277 patients presented with ≥1 surveillance drug resistance mutation (SDRM, 9.0{\%}, 95{\%} CI: 6.1-13.0{\%}). Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations were the most numerous mutations detected (n = 23). Only two patients presented with a protease inhibitor (PI) mutation. In four patients ≥4 SDRMs were detected, which might indicate that these patients were not truly ART-na{\"{i}}ve or were infected with a multi-resistant virus. CONCLUSIONS These results show that the level of antiretroviral drug resistance in ART-na{\"{i}}ve South Africans has reached moderate levels, as per the WHO classification. Therefore, regular surveys of pre-treatment drug resistance levels in all regions of South Africa is highly recommended to monitor the changing levels of pre-treatment antiretroviral drug resistance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The effect of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) on first-line combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for HIV-1 needs further study to inform choice of optimum drug regimens. We investigated the effect of TDR on outcome in the first year of cART within a large European collaboration. METHODS HIV-infected patients of any age were included if they started cART (at least three antiretroviral drugs) for the first time after Jan 1, 1998, and were antiretroviral naive and had at least one sample for a genotypic test taken before the start of cART. We used the WHO drug resistance list and the Stanford algorithm to classify patients into three resistance categories: no TDR, at least one mutation and fully-active cART, or at least one mutation and resistant to at least one prescribed drug. Virological failure was defined as time to the first of two consecutive viral load measurements over 500 copies per mL after 6 months of therapy. FINDINGS Of 10,056 patients from 25 cohorts, 9102 (90{\textperiodcentered}5{\%}) had HIV without TDR, 475 (4{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}) had at least one mutation but received fully-active cART, and 479 (4{\textperiodcentered}8{\%}) had at least one mutation and resistance to at least one drug. Cumulative Kaplan-Meier estimates for virological failure at 12 months were 4{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (95{\%} CI 3{\textperiodcentered}8-4{\textperiodcentered}7) for patients in the no TDR group, 4{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (2{\textperiodcentered}9-7{\textperiodcentered}5) for those in the TDR and fully-active cART group, and 15{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} (11{\textperiodcentered}9-19{\textperiodcentered}0) for those in the TDR and resistant group (log-rank p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). The hazard ratio for the difference in virological failure between patients with TDR and resistance to at least one drug and those without TDR was 3{\textperiodcentered}13 (95{\%} CI 2{\textperiodcentered}33-4{\textperiodcentered}20, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). The hazard ratio for the difference between patients with TDR receiving fully-active cART and patients without TDR was 1{\textperiodcentered}47 (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}19-2{\textperiodcentered}38, p=0{\textperiodcentered}12). In stratified analysis, the hazard ratio for the risk of virological failure in patients with TDR who received fully-active cART that included a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) compared with those without TDR was 2{\textperiodcentered}0 (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}9-4{\textperiodcentered}7, p=0{\textperiodcentered}093).

abstract = {Transmission of drug-resistant pathogens presents an almost-universal challenge for fighting infectious diseases. Transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) can persist in the absence of drugs for considerable time. It is generally believed that differential TDRM-persistence is caused, at least partially, by variations in TDRM-fitness-costs. However, in vivo epidemiological evidence for the impact of fitness costs on TDRM-persistence is rare. Here, we studied the persistence of TDRM in HIV-1 using longitudinally-sampled nucleotide sequences from the Swiss-HIV-Cohort-Study (SHCS). All treatment-na{\"{i}}ve individuals with TDRM at baseline were included. Persistence of TDRM was quantified via reversion rates (RR) determined with interval-censored survival models. Fitness costs of TDRM were estimated in the genetic background in which they occurred using a previously published and validated machine-learning algorithm (based on in vitro replicative capacities) and were included in the survival models as explanatory variables. In 857 sequential samples from 168 treatment-na{\"{i}}ve patients, 17 TDRM were analyzed. RR varied substantially and ranged from 174.0/100-person-years;CI=[51.4, 588.8] (for 184V) to 2.7/100-person-years;[0.7, 10.9] (for 215D). RR increased significantly with fitness cost (increase by 1.6[1.3,2.0] per standard deviation of fitness costs). When subdividing fitness costs into the average fitness cost of a given mutation and the deviation from the average fitness cost of a mutation in a given genetic background, we found that both components were significantly associated with reversion-rates. Our results show that the substantial variations of TDRM persistence in the absence of drugs are associated with fitness-cost differences both among mutations and among different genetic backgrounds for the same mutation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine the interaction between CD4 cell count, viral load suppression and duration of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on mortality. METHODS Cohort analysis of HIV-infected patients initiating ART between April 2004 and June 2011 at a large public sector clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. A log-linear model with Poisson distribution was used to estimate risk of death as a function of the interaction between current CD4 count, current viral load suppression and duration on ART in 12-month intervals. We calculated predicted mortality using estimated coefficients within combinations of predictors. RESULTS Amongst 14 932 ART patients, 1985 (13.3{\%}) died. Current CD4 was the strongest predictor of death ({\textless}50 vs. ≥550 cells/mm(3) - RR: 46.3; 95{\%} CI: 26.8-80), while unsuppressed current viral load vs. suppressed (RR: 1.8; 95{\%} CI: 1.5-2.1) and short duration of ART (0-11.9 vs. 66-71.9 months RR: 1.7; 95{\%} CI: 1.2-2.3) also predicted death. Our interaction model showed that mortality was highest in the first 12 months on treatment across all CD4 and viral load strata. As current CD4 and duration on ART increased and viral load suppression occurred, mortality dropped. CD4 count was the strongest predictor of death. The relative effect of current CD4 count varied strongly by viral load and duration of ART (from 1.3 to 55). Lack of suppression increased the risk of mortality upwards of six-fold depending on time on ART and current CD4. CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that while CD4 count is the strongest predictor of death, the effect is modified by viral load and the duration of ART. Assessment of risk should take into account all three factors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Short-term morbidity and mortality rates for HIV positive soldiers in the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) would inform decisions about deployment and HIV disease management. Risks were determined according to the latest CD4+ cell count and use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV positive individuals in the SANDF and their dependents. METHODS AND FINDINGS A total of 7,114 participants were enrolled and followed for mortality over a median of 4.7 years (IQR: 1.9, 7.1 years). For a planned subset (5,976), progression of disease (POD) and grade 4, potentially life-threatening events were also ascertained. CD4+ count and viral load were measured every 3 to 6 months. Poisson regression was used to compare event rates by latest CD4+ count ({\textless}50, 50-99, 100-199, 200-349, 350-499, 500+) with a focus on upper three strata, and to estimate relative risks (RRs) (ART/no ART). Median entry CD4+ was 207 cells/mm3. During follow-up over 70{\%} were prescribed ART. Over follow-up 1,226 participants died; rates ranged from 57.6 ({\textless} 50 cells) to 0.8 (500+ cells) per 100 person years (py). Compared to those with latest CD4+ 200-349 (2.2/100 py), death rates were significantly lower (p{\textless}0.001), as expected, for those with 350-499 (0.9/100 py) and with 500+ cells (0.8/100 py). The composite outcome of death, POD or grade 4 events occurred in 2,302 participants (4,045 events); rates were similar in higher CD4+ count strata (9.4 for 350-499 and 7.9 for 500+ cells) and lower than those with counts 200-349 cells (13.5) (p{\textless}0.001). For those with latest CD4+ 350+ cells, 63{\%} of the composite outcomes (680 of 1,074) were grade 4 events. CONCLUSION Rates of morbidity and mortality are lowest among those with CD4+ count of 350 or higher and rates do not differ for those with counts of 350-499 versus 500+ cells. Grade 4 events are the predominant morbidity for participants with CD4+ counts of 350+ cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND This study aimed to evaluate HIV type-1 (HIV-1) drug resistance pretreatment and in those failing first-line non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa. METHODS This was an observational cohort. Genotypic resistance testing was performed on treatment-naive individuals and those failing first-line ART (confirmed HIV-1 RNA{\textgreater}1,000 copies/ml) from public sector clinics in Cape Town (2002-2007). Resistance profiles and mutations relative to timing of known virological failure were examined. RESULTS In total, 230 patients (120 treatment-naive and 110 with virological failure) were included: 98{\%} had clade C virus. Among treatment-naive patients, prevalence of primary resistance was 2.5{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 0.0-5.3). Three patients had one significant reverse transcriptase mutation: K65R, Y181C and G190A. Among treatment-experienced patients, 95 (86{\%}) individuals had therapy-limiting NNRTI mutations, including K103N (55{\%}), V106M (31{\%}) and Y181C (9{\%}). The M184V mutation was the most common mutation, found in 86 (78{\%}) patients. In total, 10 (9{\%}) patients had the K65R mutation. More individuals tended to develop thymidine analogue mutations when sampling occurred after 6 months of detected therapy failure (10/31 [32{\%}] individuals) compared with those who had genotyping before 6 months (15/79 [19{\%}] patients; P=0.246). CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of primary resistance in a sample of ART-naive clade C HIV-1-infected individuals in South Africa was low during the study period. Patients failing first-line ART most often developed resistance to NNRTIs and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, the two drug classes used in first-line therapy. Viral load monitoring in this setting is crucial and individual genotypes in those failing first-line therapy should be considered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND UNAIDS aims for 90{\%} of HIV-positive individuals to be diagnosed by 2020, but few attempts have been made in developing countries to estimate the fraction of the HIV-positive population that has been diagnosed. METHODS To estimate the rate of HIV diagnosis in South Africa, reported numbers of HIV tests performed in the South African public and private health sectors were aggregated, and estimates of HIV prevalence in individuals tested for HIV were combined. The data were integrated into a mathematical model of the South African HIV epidemic, which was additionally calibrated to estimates of the fraction of the population ever tested for HIV, as reported in three national household surveys. RESULTS The fraction of HIV-positive adults who were undiagnosed declined from more than 80{\%} in the early 2000s to 23.7{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI) 23.1-24.3] in 2012. The undiagnosed proportion in 2012 was substantially higher in men (31.9{\%}, 95{\%} CI 29.7-34.3) than in women (19.0{\%}, 95{\%} CI 17.9-19.9). Projected probabilities of experiencing disease progression (CD4 cell count {\textless}350 cells/$\mu$l) without diagnosis are more than 50{\%} for most HIV-positive adults over the age of 40. The fraction of HIV-positive adults who are undiagnosed is projected to decline to 8.9{\%} by 2020 if current targets (10 million tests per annum) are met. CONCLUSION South Africa has made significant progress in expanding access to HIV testing, and at current testing rates, the target of 90{\%} of HIV-positive adults diagnosed by 2020 is likely to be reached. However, uptake is relatively low in men and older adults.},

abstract = {The prevalence of pretreatment resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) is {\textgreater}10{\%} in many low-income countries. As a consequence, several sub-Saharan African countries have implemented, or are considering the introduction of, non-NNRTI-based first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) for treatment-na{\"{i}}ve and treatment-experienced patients. This is occurring at a time when ART programmes are expanding, in response to the World Health Organization guidelines, which recommend ART initiation regardless of CD4 cell count. Both those developments raise important questions regarding their potential impact on HIV drug resistance and the impact of HIV drug resistance on clinical outcomes. Those issues are particularly relevant to sub-Saharan Africa, where standardised ART regimens are used and where viral load monitoring and resistance testing are often not done routinely. It is therefore essential to forecast the impact of the implementation of universal ART, and the introduction of drugs such as dolutegravir to first-line regimens, on HIV drug resistance in order to inform future policies and to help ensure sustainable positive long-term outcomes. We discuss important public health considerations regarding HIV drug resistance, and describe how mathematical modelling, combined with real-world data from the four African Regions of the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS consortium, could provide an early warning system for HIV drug resistance in sub-Saharan Africa.},

abstract = {Discrete, algorithmic simulation and Monte Carlo methodologies are currently used in population biology, connectionist cognitive modeling, and physics. However, little is typically known about the sensitivity of such models to changes in the values of the model features. Traditional methods of sensitivity analysis for systems of differential equations do not apply. Sometimes, one or two parameters are modified at a time in an ad hoc fashion in an attempt to assess sensitivity. To include more model features and their interactions in a sensitivity study, while limiting computer utilization, various sampling methods have been suggested. In this article, a sensitivity study based on a Latin hypercube (LH) sampling design is compared with a similar study using a full factorial (FF), fixed-point sample. A discrete, Monte Carlo model of epidemics of influenzavirus infections in a human community is used for illustrative purposes. Although the FF scheme used over 14 times as many samples as the LH sampling one, both provided comparable predictive ability and comparable information about simulation sensitivity to model features.},

abstract = {To improve virological suppression and address the emerging threat of HIV drug resistance, many low-income and middle-income countries are moving away from non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and transitioning to dolutegravir as part of a more affordable and standardised antiretroviral therapy (ART). Although this transition could decrease the effect of rising NNRTI resistance and yield improved ART outcomes, it also presents new challenges. First, current safety concerns for dolutegravir use in women of childbearing potential require alternative solutions. Second, pre-existing resistance to the co-administered nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors might reduce effectiveness and durability of dolutegravir, particularly if there is scarce access to viral load tests to monitor treatment outcomes. Third, there is inadequate information on the genetic correlates of resistance to dolutegravir, particularly in patients infected with HIV-1 non-B subtypes. Finally, clinical management of patients with confirmed virological failure on a dolutegravir-based regimen can pose challenges because of uncertainty around whether dolutegravir resistance has actually developed and switching is needed, or whether only interventions to improve adherence without switching are sufficient. These considerations should be addressed to consolidate expected gains from widespread introduction of dolutegravir in low-income and middle-income countries.},

However, most of the available data to inform this strategy come from small, uncontrolled studies. We estimated the proportion of HIV-infected patients experiencing virological failure (VF) and developing drug resistance on dolutegravir (DTG)-based maintenance therapy. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, Methods: and conference abstracts for studies assessing VF on DTG-based maintenance therapy. Studies including ≥5 adults with an undetectable viral load on antiretroviral therapy (ART) who switched to a DTG-based mono-or dual therapy were included. Pooled proportions of VF were estimated using random-intercept logistic meta-regression and acquired drug resistance mutations described for each strategy. : Of 1719 studies considered, 21 met our selection criteria, including Results seven interventional and 14 observational studies. Eight studies including 251 patients assessed VF on DTG monotherapy and fourteen studies including 1670 participants VF on dual therapy. The participant's median age ranged from 43 to 63 years, their median nadir CD4 count from 90 to 399 cells/µl, and 27.6{\%} were female. The proportion of participants experiencing VF on DTG-monotherapy was 3.6{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.9-6.7) at 24 weeks and 8.9{\%} (95{\%} CI 4.7-16.2) at 48 weeks. Resistance mutations developed in seven (3.6{\%}) participants on DTG-monotherapy. Among patients on dual therapy, ten (0.7{\%}, 95{\%} CI 0.4-1.3) experienced VF by 48 weeks and none developed resistance to DTG. In adjusted analyses, VF at 24 weeks was less likely on dual therapy than on monotherapy (adjusted odds ratio: 0.10, 95{\%} CI 0.03-0.30).

abstract = {Background Dolutegravir is superior to efavirenz for HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) but may be associated with an increased risk for neural tube defects (NTDs) in newborns if used by women at conception. Objective To project clinical outcomes of ART policies for women of child-bearing potential in South Africa. Design Model of 3 strategies: efavirenz for all women of child-bearing potential (EFV), dolutegravir for all women of child-bearing potential (DTG), or World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended efavirenz without contraception or dolutegravir with contraception (WHO approach). Data Sources Published data on NTD risks (efavirenz, 0.05{\%}; dolutegravir, 0.67{\%} [Tsepamo study]), 48-week ART efficacy with initiation (efavirenz, 60{\%} to 91{\%}; dolutegravir, 96{\%}), and age-stratified fertility rates (2 to 139 per 1000 women). Target Population 3.1 million South African women with HIV (aged 15 to 49 years) starting or continuing first-line ART, and their children. Time Horizon 5 years. Perspective Societal. Intervention EFV, DTG, and WHO approach. Outcome Measures Deaths among women and children, sexual and pediatric HIV transmissions, and NTDs. Results of Base-Case Analysis Compared with EFV, DTG averted 13 700 women's deaths (0.44{\%} decrease) and 57 700 sexual HIV transmissions, but increased total pediatric deaths by 4400 because of more NTDs. The WHO approach offered some benefits compared with EFV, averting 4900 women's deaths and 20 500 sexual transmissions while adding 300 pediatric deaths. Overall, combined deaths among women and children were lowest with DTG (358 000 deaths) compared with the WHO approach (362 800 deaths) or EFV (367 300 deaths). Results of Sensitivity Analysis Women's deaths averted with DTG exceeded pediatric deaths added with EFV unless dolutegravir-associated NTD risk was 1.5{\%} or greater. Limitation Uncertainty in NTD risks and dolutegravir efficacy in resource-limited settings, each examined in sensitivity analyses. Conclusion Although NTD risks may be higher with dolutegravir than efavirenz, dolutegravir will lead to many fewer deaths among women, as well as fewer overall HIV transmissions. These results argue against a uniform policy of avoiding dolutegravir in women of child-bearing potential.

abstract = {The scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa substantially reduced AIDS-related deaths and new HIV infections. However, its success is threatened by the emergence of resistance to non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). The MARISA (Modelling Antiretroviral drug Resistance In South Africa) model presented here aims at investigating the time trends and factors driving NNRTI resistance in South Africa. MARISA is a compartmental model that includes the key aspects of the local HIV epidemic: continuum of care, disease progression, and gender. The dynamics of NNRTI resistance emergence and transmission are then added to this framework. Model parameters are informed using data from HIV cohorts participating in the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) and literature estimates, or fitted to UNAIDS estimates. Using this novel approach of triangulating clinical and resistance data from various sources, MARISA reproduces the time trends of HIV in South Africa in 2005–2016, with a decrease in new infections, undiagnosed individuals, and AIDS-related deaths. MARISA captures the dynamics of the spread of NNRTI resistance: high levels of acquired drug resistance (ADR, in 83{\%} of first-line treatment failures in 2016), and increasing transmitted drug resistance (TDR, in 8.1{\%} of ART initiators in 2016). Simulation of counter-factual scenarios reflecting alternative public health policies shows that increasing treatment coverage would have resulted in fewer new infections and deaths, at the cost of higher TDR (11.6{\%} in 2016 for doubling the treatment rate). Conversely, improving switching to second-line treatment would have led to lower TDR (6.5{\%} in 2016 for doubling the switching rate) and fewer new infections and deaths. Implementing drug resistance testing would have had little impact. The rapid ART scale-up and inadequate switching to second-line treatment were the key drivers of the spread of NNRTI resistance in South Africa. However, even though some interventions could have substantially reduced the level of NNRTI resistance, no policy including NNRTI-based first line regimens could have prevented this spread. Thus, by combining epidemiological data on HIV in South Africa with biological data on resistance evolution, our modelling approach identified key factors driving NNRTI resistance, highlighting the need of alternative first-line regimens.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The effect of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) on first-line combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for HIV-1 needs further study to inform choice of optimum drug regimens. We investigated the effect of TDR on outcome in the first year of cART within a large European collaboration. METHODS HIV-infected patients of any age were included if they started cART (at least three antiretroviral drugs) for the first time after Jan 1, 1998, and were antiretroviral naive and had at least one sample for a genotypic test taken before the start of cART. We used the WHO drug resistance list and the Stanford algorithm to classify patients into three resistance categories: no TDR, at least one mutation and fully-active cART, or at least one mutation and resistant to at least one prescribed drug. Virological failure was defined as time to the first of two consecutive viral load measurements over 500 copies per mL after 6 months of therapy. FINDINGS Of 10,056 patients from 25 cohorts, 9102 (90{\textperiodcentered}5{\%}) had HIV without TDR, 475 (4{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}) had at least one mutation but received fully-active cART, and 479 (4{\textperiodcentered}8{\%}) had at least one mutation and resistance to at least one drug. Cumulative Kaplan-Meier estimates for virological failure at 12 months were 4{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (95{\%} CI 3{\textperiodcentered}8-4{\textperiodcentered}7) for patients in the no TDR group, 4{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (2{\textperiodcentered}9-7{\textperiodcentered}5) for those in the TDR and fully-active cART group, and 15{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} (11{\textperiodcentered}9-19{\textperiodcentered}0) for those in the TDR and resistant group (log-rank p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). The hazard ratio for the difference in virological failure between patients with TDR and resistance to at least one drug and those without TDR was 3{\textperiodcentered}13 (95{\%} CI 2{\textperiodcentered}33-4{\textperiodcentered}20, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). The hazard ratio for the difference between patients with TDR receiving fully-active cART and patients without TDR was 1{\textperiodcentered}47 (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}19-2{\textperiodcentered}38, p=0{\textperiodcentered}12). In stratified analysis, the hazard ratio for the risk of virological failure in patients with TDR who received fully-active cART that included a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) compared with those without TDR was 2{\textperiodcentered}0 (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}9-4{\textperiodcentered}7, p=0{\textperiodcentered}093).

abstract = {BACKGROUND The World Health Organization recommends that antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs in resource-limited settings develop third-line ART policies. South Africa developed a national third-line ART program for patients who have failed both first-line non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART and second-line protease inhibitor (PI)-based ART. We report on this program. METHODS Third-line ART in South Africa is accessed through a national committee that assesses eligibility and makes individual regimen recommendations. Criteria for third-line include the following: ≥1 year on PI-based ART with virologic failure, despite adherence optimization, and genotypic antiretroviral resistance test showing PI resistance. We describe baseline characteristics and resistance patterns of this cohort and present longitudinal data on virological suppression rates. RESULTS Between August 2013 and July 2014, 144 patients were approved for third-line ART. Median age was 41 years [interquartile range (IQR): 19-47]; 60{\%} were women (N = 85). Median CD4 count and viral load were 172 (IQR: 128-351) and 14,759 (IQR: 314-90,378), respectively. About 2.8{\%} started PI-based ART before 2004; 11.1{\%} from 2004 to 2007; 31.3{\%} from 2008 to 2011; and 6.3{\%} from 2012 to 2014 (48.6{\%} unknown start date). Of the 144 patients, 97{\%} and 98{\%} had resistance to lopinavir and atazanavir, respectively; 57{\%} had resistance to darunavir. All were initiated on a regimen containing darunavir, with raltegravir in 101, and etravirine in 33. Among those with at least 1 viral load at least 6 months after third-line approval (n = 118), a large proportion (83{\%}, n = 98) suppressed to {\textless}1000 copies per milliliter, and 79{\%} (n = 93) to {\textless}400 copies per milliliter. CONCLUSION A high proportion of third-line patients with follow-up viral loads are virologically suppressed.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Dolutegravir (DTG) is recommended as part of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living with HIV(PLHIV). We sought to determine the rate of adverse events (AEs) and discontinuations among Thais treated during acute HIV infection (AHI) and switched to DTG-based regimens. METHODS Thai participants in the SEARCH010/RV254 cohort who initiated ART during AHI and switched to DTG for at least 48 weeks were prospectively observed and included in the analysis. Rates and characteristics of DTG-related AEs and discontinuations were described. RESULTS A total of 313 Thai participants were included in the analysis. The median age was 29 years, 96{\%} were male, 64{\%} had a Bachelor's degree or higher and 16{\%} had a body mass index (BMI) {\textless}18.5 kg/m2 . Participants were on ART for a median of 124 weeks before switching to DTG. The median (IQR) body weight increased from 63 (56 to 70) kg before to 65 (58 to 73) kg (p {\textless} 0.0001) after 48 weeks of DTG. Forty-nine (16{\%}) developed DTG-related AEs, corresponding to an incidence of 16.6 per 100 person-years. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were most frequently encountered (n = 25, 8{\%}), followed by laboratory abnormalities (n = 16, 5{\%}). Six (2{\%}) discontinued DTG, corresponding to an incidence of 2.4 per 100 person-years. All discontinuations were due to increased liver enzymes in the presence of hepatitis C virus coinfection. In the multivariate analysis, incident hepatitis C virus infection was the only risk factor for discontinuing DTG (hazard ratio 59.4, 95{\%} CI 8.5 to 297.9, p {\textless} 0.0001). Neither low BMI nor concurrent abacavir therapy was associated with discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS DTG was well tolerated with few discontinuations in this cohort of young men. Incident hepatitis C virus infection was a driver of liver-related AEs leading to discontinuations. In populations at risk, regular testing for hepatitis C virus during ART is recommended to anticipate possible AEs, guide management and improve safety.},

abstract = {The accumulation of drug-resistance mutations on combined antiretroviral regimens (ART) backbone could affect the virological efficacy of the regimen. Our aim was to assess the impact of previous drug resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) on the probability of virological failure (VF) in patients, under virological control, who switched to dolutegravir (DTG)+2NRTIs regimens. All HIV-1 positive drug-experienced patients who started a regimen composed by DTG+2NRTIs [abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/emtricitabine (FTC)] in the ARCA collaborative group with HIV-RNA {\textless}50 cp/mL were included in the analysis. Patients with a previous VF to integrase inhibitors were excluded. The impact of single and combined NRTIs mutations on the probability of VF (defined as 2 consecutive HIV-RNA {\textgreater}50 copies/mL or one HIV-RNA {\textgreater}1000 copies/mL) was assessed by Kaplan Meier curves. A multivariable Cox regression analysis was constructed to assess factors potentially related to VF. Five hundred and eighty-eight patients were included in the analysis with a median time of viral suppression before the switch of 37 months (IQR 12–78), of whom 148 (25.2{\%}) had at least one previous NRTIs resistance mutation. In the multivariable model no association was observed between NRTIs mutations and VF. Conversely, the duration of viral suppression before switch resulted associated with a lower risk of VF (for 1 month increase, adjusted Hazard Ratio 0.98, 95{\%}CI 0.96–0.99; p=0.024). Previous NRTIs mutations appeared to have no impact on the risk of VF in patients switched to DTG+2NRTIs, whereas a longer interval on a controlled viremia decreased significantly the risk of VF.},

However, the full spectrum of reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations selected in individuals with VF on such a regimen is not known.

To identify TRAMs specifically associated with TDF-selection pressure, we compared the proportion of each TRAM to its proportion in a cohort of 5805 individuals with VF on a first-line thymidine analog-containing regimen. We identified 83 TRAMs including 33 NRTI-associated, 40 NNRTI-associated, and 10 uncommon mutations of uncertain provenance. Of the 33 NRTI-associated TRAMs, 12 – A62V, K65R/N, S68G/N/D, K70E/Q/T, L74I, V75L, and Y115F – were more common among individuals receiving a first-line TDF-containing compared to a first-line thymidine analog-containing regimen. These 12 TDF-selected TRAMs will be important for monitoring TDF-associated transmitted drug-resistance and for determining the extent of reduced TDF susceptibility in individuals with VF on a TDF-containing regimen.},

Methods: A systematic review identified phase 3/4 RCTs in treatment-na{\"{i}}ve patients with HIV-1 receiving core agents: ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), or integrase strand inhibitors (INSTIs). Efficacy (virologic suppression [VS], CD4+ cell count change from baseline) and safety (adverse events [AEs], discontinuations, discontinuation due to AEs, lipid changes) were analyzed at Week 48 using Bayesian NMA methodology, which allowed calculation of probabilistic results. Subgroup analyses were conducted for VS (baseline viral load [VL] ≤/{\textgreater} 100,000copies/mL, ≤/{\textgreater} 500,000copies/mL; baseline CD4+ ≤/{\textgreater}200cells/$\mu$L). Results were adjusted for the nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) combined with the core agent (except subgroup analyses). Results: The NMA included 36 studies; 2 additional studies were included in subgroup analyses only. Odds of achieving VS with DTG were statistically superior to PIs (odds ratios [ORs] 1.78-2.59) and NNRTIs (ORs 1.51-1.86), and similar but numerically higher than other INSTIs. CD4+ count increase was significantly greater with DTG than PIs (difference: 23.63-31.47 cells/$\mu$L) and efavirenz (difference: 34.54 cells/$\mu$L), and similar to other core agents. INSTIs were more likely to result in patients achieving VS versus PIs (probability: 76-100{\%}) and NNRTIs (probability: 50-100{\%}), and a greater CD4+ count increase versus PIs (probability: 72-100{\%}) and NNRTIs (probability: 60-100{\%}). DTG was more likely to result in patients achieving VS (probability: 94-100{\%}), and a greater CD4+ count increase (probability: 53-100{\%}) versus other core agents, including INSTIs (probability: 94-97{\%} and 53-93{\%}, respectively). Safety outcomes with DTG were generally similar to other core agents. In patients with baseline VL {\textgreater} 100,000copies/mL or ≤ 200 CD4+cells/$\mu$L (18 studies), odds of achieving VS with DTG were superior or similar to other core agents. Conclusion: INSTI core agents had superior efficacy and similar safety to PIs and NNRTIs at Week 48 in treatment-na{\"{i}}ve patients with HIV-1, with DTG being among the most efficacious, including in patients with baseline VL {\textgreater} 100,000copies/mL or ≤ 200 CD4+cells/$\mu$L, who can be difficult to treat.},

abstract = {Drug resistant HIV is a major threat to the long-term efficacy of antiretroviral treatment. Around 10{\%} of ART-na{\"{i}}ve patients in Europe are infected with drug-resistant HIV type 1. Hence it is important to understand the dynamics of transmitted drug resistance evolution. Thanks to routinely performed drug resistance tests, HIV sequence data is increasingly available and can be used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship among viral lineages. In this study we employ a phylodynamic approach to quantify the fitness costs of major resistance mutations in the Swiss HIV cohort. The viral phylogeny reflects the transmission tree, which we model using stochastic birth–death-sampling processes with two types: hosts infected by a sensitive or resistant strain. This allows quantification of fitness cost as the ratio between transmission rates of hosts infected by drug resistant strains and transmission rates of hosts infected by drug sensitive strains. The resistance mutations 41L, 67N, 70R, 184V, 210W, 215D, 215S and 219Q (nRTI-related) and 103N, 108I, 138A, 181C, 190A (NNRTI-related) in the reverse trancriptase and the 90M mutation in the protease gene are included in this study. Among the considered resistance mutations, only the 90M mutation in the protease gene was found to have significantly higher fitness than the drug sensitive strains. The following mutations associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were found to be less fit than the sensitive strains: 67N, 70R, 184V, 219Q. The highest posterior density intervals of the transmission ratios for the remaining resistance mutations included in this study all included 1, suggesting that these mutations do not have a significant effect on viral transmissibility within the Swiss HIV cohort. These patterns are consistent with alternative measures of the fitness cost of resistance mutations. Overall, we have developed and validated a novel phylodynamic approach to estimate the transmission fitness cost of drug resistance mutations.},
