**Predicted levels of NNRTI pre-treatment drug resistance in South Africa (PDR) 2005-2040.**
Dolutegravir is introduced in 2020 under three scenarios: DTG as first-line regimen for ART-initiators (panel A), DTG for all patients (panel B) or DTG for all patients, assuming an impact of NRTI-resistance on DTG-efficacy (panel C), and with different eligibility criteria for women (colors). The baseline model shows the situation without the introduction of DTG (black line). The two boxes on the right of each panel represent the levels of NNRTI PDR in 2040 and their 95% sensitivity ranges.
